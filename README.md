# WESERS2

Hello everyone, This is my new repository
# Add the following files
    What we did in class: 
- createPersons.sql -> change the db name to be your name
- credentials.php -> change the db name as well to the same name you use above
- Signup.php -> it should work just as given

    ADD code to your login.php
- fill in the login.php file to present the user with a username/password form
- handle this form to login OR give the correct messages (user does not exist/ password is wrong) !
